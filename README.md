# UnityAutoSaver
 a tool I wrote in frustration after I lost an hour worth of work due to a Unity crash
 
# How to use
 copy the Assets/AutoSave directory to your project, thats it. You can customise save frequency, auto start and log through the properties asset generated under Assets root directory.
